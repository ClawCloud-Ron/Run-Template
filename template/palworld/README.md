### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Before deploying the server, set the following environment variables to customize your server:

- **SERVER_NAME**: (Optional) Define a unique name for your server that will be visible to players.
- **SERVER_PASSWORD**: (Optional) Set a password to restrict access to your server.

Then Deploy the Palworld Server.

### 2. Configure Network Access
To allow players to connect to your server, enable internet access for the required ports:

1) Go to App Launchpad:
Locate your deployed Palworld server instance (e.g., palworld-{xxxxx}) and click Details.

2) Manage Network Settings:
Navigate to Manage Network.
Enable internet access for the following ports:
8211: Used for game traffic.
27015: Used for Steam-related communication.

3) Update Configuration:
After enabling the ports, you will get 2 public addresses (e.g., xxxx.us-east-1.clawcloudrun.com), then click Update to apply the changes.

### 3. Verify Port Mapping
