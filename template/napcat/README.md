# NapCatQQ  
Modern NTQQ Protocol-Based Bot Framework Implementation  
Ôªø
## What is NapCat?  
A TypeScript-built bot framework that actively invokes QQ client's Node module interfaces through launchers or framework adapters to implement bot functionalities.

## ‚ú® Key Features  
Ôªø
### üì¶ Out-of-the-Box  
- Multiple deployment options for Windows/Linux/macOS (x64 architecture)  
- Quick deployment via Docker/CLI/Package Managers  
Ôªø
### üíñ Memory Efficiency  
- Headless architecture without Electron dependency  
- Ultra-low memory footprint
Ôªø
### üõ†Ô∏è Flexible Adaptation  
- Core/Adapter architecture design  
- Multi-protocol support with seamless migration  
Ôªø
## ‚ö° NapCat vs Other Frameworks  
Ôªø
### Protocol Layer Comparison  
Unlike implementations that fully recreate QQ messaging features, NapCat actively invokes existing client-side functionalities.  
Ôªø
### Hook Layer Advantages  
- Self-bootstrapping QQ process initialization  
- Full API ownership without dependency injection  
- No requirement for traditional hook mechanisms  
Ôªø
### Electron IPC Alternative  
- Independent from Electron framework  
- Direct access to underlying Node modules  
- Potential to operate without main QQ process dependency
